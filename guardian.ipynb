      "Carly Fiorina has chutzpah. The former CEO of Hewlett Packett isn’t just running for the Republican nomination for president on a platform of managerial expertise after a controversial tenure at that technology company from 1999 to 2005. She’s running as a foreign policy maven despite having never served in elected office. In an interview with the Guardian on Saturday, Fiorina bragged that she “knows more world leaders on the stage” than any of her competitors for the 2016 nomination, a claim she echoed in a speech shortly afterwards at Iowa senator Joni Ernst’s inaugural Roast and Ride fundraiser. The former CEO argued that she “conducted business and charitable work” with world leaders “for many years”. She contrasted herself with mere politicians by saying: “I don’t do photo ops. I don’t do codels [congressional delegations].” Fiorina insisted “I know these people. I know how they think about us.” Her foreign policy worldview, though, seemed to be more focused on criticism of the Obama administration than any overarching philosophy – in contrast to fellow GOP hopefuls such as Lindsey Graham or Rand Paul. Fiorina seemed to divide hostile countries into “enemies” and “adversaries”. For example, China is an “adversary” but “not an enemy yet” and certainly not “in Iran’s category or even Russia’s category”. Yet her skepticism about China did not extend to automatic support for the Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade deal which many in both parties think is crucial to combating Chinese influence in east Asia. Fiorina didn’t take a position on the controversial legislation, saying: “The [Obama] administration has a track record of setting out lofty goals that sound really good and never telling us about the details and the details are always very different than the goals.” She went on to say that she would not have supported granting Barack Obama trade promotion authority, the ability to submit a trade deal to Congress for an up-and-down vote without amendment which was recently approved in the Senate by a narrow margin, unless she knew “what’s in the [TPP].” The former Hewlett Packard executive was just as wary of recent congressional action to approve the USA Freedom Act, the first significant rollback of government surveillance since the Carter administration. Fiorina thought the compromise bill, approved by an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives, “feels like a rushed solution” and did not “think it was a step in the right direction” for the government to relinquish control of telephone metadata and let the phone carriers hold it instead. On domestic policy, Fiorina has long occupied a niche in the Republican field as perhaps the most vehement critic of the Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, a role for which there is considerable competition. In her speech at the Roast and Ride, she said she “was gratified” that she won a poll as the candidate who Republican voters most wanted to see debate Clinton. She was certainly hostile to Clinton’s most recent policy proposal, which called for automatic voter registration of every eligible American. “I don’t think it’s a good idea unless there are some safeguards on who is registering,” said Fiorina.
